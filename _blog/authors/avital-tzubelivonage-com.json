  "bio": "Avital Tzubeli is a Developer Advocate at Vonage, where she’ll be building the local Vonage community in Tel Aviv. She’s originally from Miami Beach, and first spoke Spanish and Hebrew, before learning all her English from Harry Potter books. She studied CS and wrote some Java in NYC, then moved to Tel Aviv in search of better weather… where she fortunately also discovered the world of Developer Relations. Avital considers herself a storyteller, and loves the challenge of turning technical content into magical fairytales.",
