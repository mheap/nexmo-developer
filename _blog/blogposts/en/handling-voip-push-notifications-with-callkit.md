In this tutorial, you will use [CallKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit) to handle the VoIP push notifications sent to an iOS device when using the Vonage Client SDK for iOS. CallKit allows you to integrate your iOS application into the system so your application can look like a native iOS phone call. 

<sign-up number></sign-up>

## Prerequisites

* An Apple Developer account and test device.
* A GitHub account.
* Xcode 12 and Swift 5 or greater.
* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) to install the Vonage Client SDK for iOS.
* Our Command Line Interface, which you can install with `npm install @vonage/cli -g`.

## The Starter Project

This tutorial will be building on top of the ["Receiving a phone call in-app"](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/tutorials/phone-to-app/introduction/swift) from the Vonage developer portal. The tutorial will start from cloning the finished project from GitHub, but if you are not familiar with using the Vonage Client SDK for iOS to receive a call, you can start with the tutorial. If you follow the tutorial, you can skip ahead to the create push certificates section.

### Create an NCCO

A [Nexmo Call Control Object (NCCO)](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference) is a JSON array that you use to control the flow of a Voice API call. The NCCO must be public and accessible by the internet. To accomplish that, you will be using a GitHub Gist that provides a convenient way to host the configuration.

Go to <https://gist.github.com> and enter `ncco.json` into "Filename including extension" box. The contents of the gist will be the following JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "action": "talk",
        "text": "Thank you for calling Alice"
    },
    {
        "action": "connect",
        "endpoint": [
            {
                "type": "app",
                "user": "Alice"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Create the gist, then click the "Raw" button to get a URL for your NCCO. Keep note of it for the next step.

![The Raw button as show in a GitHub Gist](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/gist.png)

### Set up a Vonage Application

You now need to create a Vonage Application. An application contains the security and configuration information you need to connect to Vonage. Create a directory for your project using `mkdir vonage-tutorial` in your terminal, then change into the new directory using `cd vonage-tutorial`. Create a vonage application using the following command replacing `GIST_URL` with the URL from the previous step:

```sh
vonage apps:create "Phone To App Tutorial" --voice-event-url=https://example.com/ --voice-answer-url=GIST_URL 
```

A file named .nexmo-app is created in your project directory and contains the newly created Vonage Application ID and the private key. A private key file named private.key is also created. 

Since the iOS app will be receiving an inbound call from a phone, you will need to buy and link a Vonage number to your application. You can search for a number by running `vonage numbers:search US`. The command searches for a US number, but you can specify an alternate [two-character country code](https://www.iban.com/country-codes). Once you find a number, you can buy it be running `vonage numbers:buy VONAGE_NUMBER US`

You can now link your new number to your application using `vonage apps:link APPLICATION_ID --number=YOUR_VONAGE_NUMBER` replacing `YOUR_VONAGE_NUMBER` with the newly generated number and `APPLICATION_ID` with your application ID.

The next step would be to create a user for your application, you can do so by running `vonage apps:users:create Alice` to create a user called Alice. The Client SDK uses JWTs for authentication. The JWT identifies the user name, the associated application ID and the permissions granted to the user. It is signed using your private key to prove that it is a valid token. You can create a JWT for the Alice user by running the following command replacing `APP_ID` with your application ID from earlier: 

```sh
vonage jwt --app_id=APP_ID --subject=Alice --key_file=./phone_to_app_tutorial.key --acl='{"paths":{"/*/users/**":{},"/*/conversations/**":{},"/*/sessions/**":{},"/*/devices/**":{},"/*/image/**":{},"/*/media/**":{},"/*/applications/**":{},"/*/push/**":{},"/*/knocking/**":{},"/*/legs/**":{}}}'
```

### Clone the iOS Project

To get a local copy of the iOS project your terminal, enter `git clone git@github.com:nexmo-community/client-sdk-tutorials.git` in your terminal. Change directory into the `PhoneToApp` folder by using `cd client-sdk-tutorials/phone-to-app-swift/PhoneToApp`. Then make sure that the dependencies of the project are installed and up to date. You can do so by running `pod install`. Once complete, you can open the Xcode project by running using `open PhoneToApp.xcworkspace`.

## Set up Push Certificatesn

There are two types of push notifications that you can use in an iOS app, VoIP pushes with PushKit or User Notifications. This tutorial will be focusing on VoIP pushes. [Apple Push Notifications service](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1) (APNs) uses certificate-based authentication to secure the connections between APNs and Vonage servers. So you will need to create a certificate and upload it to the Vonage Servers so Vonage can send a push to the device when there is an incoming call.

### Adding a Push Notification Capability

To use push notifications, you are required to add the push notification capability to your Xcode project. Make sure you are logged into your Apple developer account in Xcode via preferences. If so, select your target and then choose *Signing & Capabilities*:

![Signing and capabilities tag](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/signing.png)

Then select add capability and add the *Push Notifications* capability:

![Add capability button](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/add-capability.png)

If Xcode is automatically managing your app's signing, it will update the provisioning profile linked to your Bundle Identifier to include the capability. Repeat the process for the *Background Modes* capability and select Voice over IP:

![Add background voip mode](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/background-modes.png)

When using VoIP push notifications, you have to use the CallKit framework. Link it to your project by adding it under *Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content* under General:

![Add callkit framework](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/callkitframework.png)

### Generating a Push Certificate

To generate a push certificate, you will need to log in to your Apple developer account and head to the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list) page and add a new certificate:

![Add certificate button](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/add-certificate.png)

Choose a VoIP Services Certificate and continue. You will now need to choose the App ID for the app that you want to add VoIP push notifications to and continue. If your app is not listed, you will have to create an App ID. Xcode can do this for you if it automatically manages your signing. Otherwise, you can create a new App ID on the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list) page under Identifiers. Make sure to select the push notifications capability when doing so.

You will be prompted to upload a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). You can follow the instructions on [Apple's help website](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devbfa00fef7) to create a CSR on your Mac. Once the CSR is uploaded, you will be able to download the certificate. Double click the `.cer` file to install it in Keychain Access.

To get the push certificate in the format that is needed by the Vonage servers, you will need to export it. Locate your VoIP Services certificate in Keychain Access and right-click to export it. Name the export `applecert` and select `.p12` as the format:

![Keychain access export](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/keychain-export.png)

### Upload Your Push Certificate

Now that you have a push certificate linked to your iOS application, you need to upload it to the Vonage servers. You upload your certificate to the Vonage servers by making a POST request, you can do so using your terminal or using the upload tool. Using the terminal, clone the upload tool with `git clone git@github.com:nexmo-community/ios-push-uploader.git`, then change into the directory with `cd ios-push-uploader`. To run the tool, install the dependencies with `npm install` once that is complete run the project with `node server.js`. The tool will be available on your localhost on port printed to the terminal.

Enter your Vonage Application ID, private key, and certificate file and upload. The page will show the status of your upload on the page once it is complete.

![Our upload tool success notification](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/pushupload.png)

## The ClientManager Class

Create a new Swift file (CMD + N) and call it `ClientManager`. This class will encapsulate the code needed to interface with the Client SDK since you will need to get information from the Client SDK in multiple places in future steps:

```swift
final class ClientManager: NSObject {

    static let shared = ClientManager()

    static let jwt = "ALICE_JWT"

    override init() {
        super.init()
        initializeClient()
    }

    func initializeClient() {
        NXMClient.shared.setDelegate(self)
    }
    
    func login() {
        guard !NXMClient.shared.isConnected() else { return }
        NXMClient.shared.login(withAuthToken: ClientManager.jwt)
    }
}
```

Replace `ALICE_JWT` with the JWT you generated earlier, in a production environment, this is where you would fetch a JWT fro your authentication server/endpoint. With this new class, you will need to move the call Client SDK code from the `ViewController` class to the `ClientManager` class. The two classes will communicate with `NotificationCenter` observers. Make the following changes to your `ViewController` class:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    let connectionStatusLabel = UILabel()
    var call: NXMCall?
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        
        connectionStatusLabel.text = "Connected"
        connectionStatusLabel.textAlignment = .center
        connectionStatusLabel.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        
        view.addSubview(connectionStatusLabel)
        view.addConstraints(NSLayoutConstraint.constraints(withVisualFormat: "H:|-20-[label]-20-|",
                                                           options: [], metrics: nil, views: ["label" : connectionStatusLabel]))
        view.addConstraints(NSLayoutConstraint.constraints(withVisualFormat: "V:|-80-[label(20)]",
                                                           options: [], metrics: nil, views: ["label" : connectionStatusLabel]))
        
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(statusReceived(_:)), name: .clientStatus, object: nil)
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(callReceived(_:)), name: .incomingCall, object: nil)
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(callHandled), name: .handledCallCallKit, object: nil)
    }
    
    deinit {
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self)
    }
    
    @objc func statusReceived(_ notification: NSNotification) {
        DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
            self?.connectionStatusLabel.text = notification.object as? String
        }
    }
    
    @objc func callReceived(_ notification: NSNotification) {
        DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
            if let call = notification.object as? NXMCall {
                self?.displayIncomingCallAlert(call: call)
            }
        }
    }
    
    @objc func callHandled() {
        DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
            if self?.presentedViewController != nil {
                self?.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
            }
        }
    }
    
    func displayIncomingCallAlert(call: NXMCall) {
        var from = "Unknown"
        if let otherParty = call.allMembers.first {
            from = otherParty.channel?.from.data ?? "Unknown"
        }
        let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Incoming call from", message: from, preferredStyle: .alert)
        alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Answer", style: .default, handler: { _ in
            self.call = call
            NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .handledCallApp, object: nil)
            call.answer(nil)
            
        }))
        alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Reject", style: .default, handler: { _ in
            NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .handledCallApp, object: nil)
            call.reject(nil)
        }))
        
        self.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

Rather than logging being the delegate for the Client SDK, the `ViewController` class now listens for updates and reacts to them. Now update the `ClientManager` class to send these updates. Add the following to the end of the `ClientManager.swift` file:

```swift
extension ClientManager: NXMClientDelegate {
    func client(_ client: NXMClient, didChange status: NXMConnectionStatus, reason: NXMConnectionStatusReason) {
        let statusText: String
        
        switch status {
        case .connected:
            statusText = "Connected"
        case .disconnected:
            statusText = "Disconnected"
        case .connecting:
            statusText = "Connecting"
        @unknown default:
            statusText = "Unknown"
        }
        
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .clientStatus, object: statusText)
    }

    func client(_ client: NXMClient, didReceiveError error: Error) {
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .clientStatus, object: error.localizedDescription)
    }

    func client(_ client: NXMClient, didReceive call: NXMCall) {
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .incomingCall, object: call)
    }
}

struct Constants {
    static let pushToken = "NXMPushToken"
    static let fromKeyPath = "nexmo.push_info.from_user.name"
}

extension Notification.Name {
    static let clientStatus = Notification.Name("Status")
    static let incomingCall = Notification.Name("Call")
    static let handledCallCallKit = Notification.Name("CallHandledCallKit")
    static let handledCallApp = Notification.Name("CallHandledApp")
}
```

## Register for Push Notifications

The next step is to register a device for push notifications to let Vonage know which device to send the push notification to for which user. In the `ClientManager` class add the `pushToken` property and the following functions to handle the push token of the device:

```swift
final class ClientManager: NSObject {
    public var pushToken: Data?

    ...

    func invalidatePushToken() {
        self.pushToken = nil
        UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: Constants.pushToken)
        NXMClient.shared.disablePushNotifications(nil)
    }

    private func enableNXMPushIfNeeded(with token: Data) {
        if shouldRegisterToken(with: token) {
            NXMClient.shared.enablePushNotifications(withPushKitToken: token, userNotificationToken: nil, isSandbox: true) { error in
                if error != nil {
                    print("registration error: \(String(describing: error))")
                }
                print("push token registered")
                UserDefaults.standard.setValue(token, forKey: Constants.pushToken)
            }
        }
    }

    private func shouldRegisterToken(with token: Data) -> Bool {
        let storedToken = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey: Constants.pushToken) as? Data
        
        if let storedToken = storedToken, storedToken == token {
            return false
        }
        
        invalidatePushToken()
        return true
    }
}
```

The `enableNXMPushIfNeeded` function takes a token, then uses the `shouldRegisterToken` function to check if the token has already been registered. If it has not `enablePushNotifications` on the client will register the push notification with Vonage. In the `AppDelegate` class you can now register for VoIP push notifications. Import `PushKit` at the top of the file:

```swift
import PushKit
```

Add a local instance of the `ClientManager` class:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    ...
    private let clientManager = ClientManager.shared
    ...
}
```

Create a new extension at the end of the file which contains a function to register the device for push notifications:

```swift
extension AppDelegate: PKPushRegistryDelegate {
    func registerForVoIPPushes() {
        let voipRegistry = PKPushRegistry(queue: nil)
        voipRegistry.delegate = self
        voipRegistry.desiredPushTypes = [PKPushType.voIP]
    }
}
```

Update the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function to call the `registerForVoIPPushes` function and log in the Client SDK:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().requestRecordPermission { (granted:Bool) in
        print("Allow microphone use. Response: \(granted)")
    }
    registerForVoIPPushes()
    clientManager.login()
    return true
}
```

Add the `PKPushRegistryDelegate` functions to handle the push notification registration to the extension:

```swift
extension AppDelegate: PKPushRegistryDelegate {
    ...

    func pushRegistry(_ registry: PKPushRegistry, didUpdate pushCredentials: PKPushCredentials, for type: PKPushType) {
        clientManager.pushToken = pushCredentials.token
    }

    func pushRegistry(_ registry: PKPushRegistry, didInvalidatePushTokenFor type: PKPushType) {
        clientManager.invalidatePushToken()
    }
}
```

The push token is stored as a property on the `ClientManager` class as you only want to register the token with Vonage when the client is logged in so edit the `NXMClientDelegate` function in the `ClientManager` class to handle this:

```swift
func client(_ client: NXMClient, didChange status: NXMConnectionStatus, reason: NXMConnectionStatusReason) {
    let statusText: String
    
    switch status {
    case .connected:
        if let token = pushToken {
            enableNXMPushIfNeeded(with: token)
        }
        statusText = "Connected"
    case .disconnected:
        statusText = "Disconnected"
    case .connecting:
        statusText = "Connecting"
    @unknown default:
        statusText = "Unknown"
    }
    
    NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .clientStatus, object: statusText)
}
```

## Handle Incoming Push Notifications

With the device registered, it can now receive push notifications from Vonage. The Client SDK has functions for checking is a push notification payload is the expected payload and for processing the payload. You can view the JSON Vonage sends in the [push payload documentation](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/in-app-voice/guides/push-notification-payload.md). When `processNexmoPushPayload` is called, it converts the payload into an NXMCall which is received on the `didReceive` function of the `NXMClientDelegate`.  Implement the functions on the `ClientManager` class alongside a local variable to store an incoming push: 

```swift
typealias PushInfo = (payload: PKPushPayload, completion: () -> Void)

final class ClientManager: NSObject {
    ...
    public var pushInfo: PushInfo?

    ...

    func isNexmoPush(with userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]) -> Bool {
        return NXMClient.shared.isNexmoPush(userInfo: userInfo)
    }

    private func processNexmoPushPayload(with pushInfo: PushInfo) {
        guard let _ = NXMClient.shared.processNexmoPushPayload(pushInfo.payload.dictionaryPayload) else {
            print("Nexmo push processing error")
            return
        }
        pushInfo.completion()
        self.pushInfo = nil
    }

    ...
}
```

Much like the push token, you only want to process an incoming push when the Client SDK has been logged in, so update the `NXMClientDelegate` to process the push when the Client SDK successfully connects:

```swift
func client(_ client: NXMClient, didChange status: NXMConnectionStatus, reason: NXMConnectionStatusReason) {
    let statusText: String
    
    switch status {
    case .connected:
        if let token = pushToken {
            enableNXMPushIfNeeded(with: token)
        }
        if let pushInfo = pushInfo {
            processNexmoPushPayload(with: pushInfo)
        }
        statusText = "Connected"
    case .disconnected:
        statusText = "Disconnected"
    case .connecting:
        statusText = "Connecting"
    @unknown default:
        statusText = "Unknown"
    }
    
    NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .clientStatus, object: statusText)
}
```

The `PKPushRegistryDelegate` has a function that is called when there is an incoming push called `didReceiveIncomingPushWith` add it to the extension `PKPushRegistryDelegate` in the `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
func pushRegistry(_ registry: PKPushRegistry, didReceiveIncomingPushWith payload: PKPushPayload, for type: PKPushType, completion: @escaping () -> Void) {
    if clientManager.isNexmoPush(with: payload.dictionaryPayload) {
        let pushDict = payload.dictionaryPayload as NSDictionary
        let from = pushDict.value(forKeyPath: Constants.fromKeyPath) as? String
        
        clientManager.pushInfo = (payload, completion)
    }
}
```

When your iOS application has an incoming VoIP push notification, you must handle it using the [`CXProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxprovider) class in the CallKit framework. Create a new Swift file (CMD + N) called `ProviderDelegate`:

```swift
import CallKit
import NexmoClient
import AVFoundation

struct PushCall {
    var call: NXMCall?
    var uuid: UUID?
    var answerAction: CXAnswerCallAction?
}

final class ProviderDelegate: NSObject {
    private let provider: CXProvider
    private let callController = CXCallController()
    private var activeCall: PushCall? = PushCall()
    
    override init() {
        provider = CXProvider(configuration: ProviderDelegate.providerConfiguration)
        super.init()
        provider.setDelegate(self, queue: nil)
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(callReceived(_:)), name: .incomingCall, object: nil)
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(callHandled), name: .handledCallApp, object:nil)
    }
    
    deinit {
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self)
    }
    
    static var providerConfiguration: CXProviderConfiguration = {
        let providerConfiguration = CXProviderConfiguration(localizedName: "Vonage Call")
        providerConfiguration.supportsVideo = false
        providerConfiguration.maximumCallsPerCallGroup = 1
        providerConfiguration.supportedHandleTypes = [.generic]
        return providerConfiguration
    }()
}
```

The `activeCall` property uses the `PushCall` struct to keep track of the active call's details, `callController` is a `CXCallController` object used by the class to handle user actions on the CallKit UI. This tutorial supports handling one call at a time, to handle multiple calls you will want to create a new class to encapsulate the two properties. Next, create an extension at the end of the file to implement the `CXProviderDelegate`:

```swift
extension ProviderDelegate: CXProviderDelegate {
    func providerDidReset(_ provider: CXProvider) {
        activeCall = PushCall()
    }
    
    func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, perform action: CXAnswerCallAction) {
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .handledCallCallKit, object: nil)
        configureAudioSession()
        activeCall?.answerAction = action
        
        if activeCall?.call != nil {
            action.fulfill()
        }
    }
    
    private func answerCall(with action: CXAnswerCallAction) {
        activeCall?.call?.answer(nil)
        activeCall?.call?.setDelegate(self)
        activeCall?.uuid = action.callUUID
        action.fulfill()
    }
    
    func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, perform action: CXEndCallAction) {

When the CallKit UI answers the call, it calls the `CXAnswerCallAction` delegate function. If the device is locked, the Client SDK needs time to reinitialize, so the `CXAnswerCallAction` action is stored to be fulfilled later. Fulfilling a `CXAnswerCallAction` will notify CallKit that the device is ready to start the call and will activate the audio session and call the `didActivate` audio session function on the `CXProviderDelegate`. If the app is in the foreground, the call object is not nil; the call is ready to be answered so the `CXAnswerCallAction` is fulfilled.

The `reportCall` function will be called from the `AppDelegate` class when an incoming push notification is received to tell the system to display the CallKit UI with the option to either pick up or reject the call. 

The `callReceived` function would be called after the push payload is processed so you will store it and fulfil the `CXAnswerCallAction`. The `handledCallCallKit` notification is sent so that the `ViewController` class knows that the call has been handled by CallKit UI and can dismiss the alert shown to pick up a call. Add an extension to keep track of the status of the ongoing call using the `NXMCallDelegate`:

```swift
extension ProviderDelegate: NXMCallDelegate {
    func call(_ call: NXMCall, didReceive error: Error) {
        print(error)
        hangup()
    }
    
    func call(_ call: NXMCall, didUpdate callMember: NXMMember, with status: NXMCallMemberStatus) {
        switch status {
        case .cancelled, .failed, .timeout, .rejected, .completed:
            hangup()
        default:
            break
        }
    }
    
    func call(_ call: NXMCall, didUpdate callMember: NXMMember, isMuted muted: Bool) {}

    private func hangup() {
        if let uuid = activeCall?.uuid {
            activeCall?.call?.hangup()
            activeCall = PushCall()
            
            let action = CXEndCallAction(call: uuid)
            let transaction = CXTransaction(action: action)
            
            callController.request(transaction) { error in
                if let error = error {
                    print(error)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If there is an error with the call or the other party hangs up, the Client SDK will end the call, and the system notified with a `CXEndCallAction` via the `callController` object. Now that the `ProviderDelegate` class is complete create an instance of it in the `AppDelegate` class and call `reportCall` when there is an incoming call:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    ...

    private let providerDelegate = ProviderDelegate()

    ...
}

extension AppDelegate: PKPushRegistryDelegate {

    ...

    func pushRegistry(_ registry: PKPushRegistry, didReceiveIncomingPushWith payload: PKPushPayload, for type: PKPushType, completion: @escaping () -> Void) {
        if clientManager.isNexmoPush(with: payload.dictionaryPayload) {
            let pushDict = payload.dictionaryPayload as NSDictionary
            let from = pushDict.value(forKeyPath: Constants.fromKeyPath) as? String
            
            clientManager.pushInfo = (payload, completion)
            providerDelegate.reportCall(callerID: from ?? "Vonage Call")
        }
    }
}
```

## Try it out

Build and Run (CMD + R) the project onto your iOS device, accept the microphone permissions, and lock the device. Then call the number linked to your Vonage Application from earlier. You will see the incoming call directly on your lock screen; then once you pick up it will go into the familiar iOS call screen:

![Incoming call on a locked screen](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/loackedcallsm.png)

![An active call in progress](/content/blog/handling-voip-push-notifications-with-callkit/activecallsm.png)

If you check the call logs on the device, you will also see the call listed there.

## What Next?

You can find the completed project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/swift-phone-to-app-callkit). You can do a lot more with the Client SDK and CallKit; you can use CallKit for outbound calls.
