Whether you attended one of our events, participated in a challenge, or spoke with one of our lovely [DevRel Team Members](https://developer.vonage.com/team), you likely will have come across one of our coupon codes.

In this blog post, you will learn what a coupon code is, and how to redeem it to go forth and build amazing things. 

### What is a Coupon Code?

A coupon code is our way to encourage you to build amazing projects. Redeeming a coupon code will increase your account balance and enable you to use this balance for various projects. 

Typically our coupon codes are alphanumeric codes and may be given out as part of workshops, talks, or special events. 

These coupon codes will only be valid for a specific period of time, so be sure to redeem them quickly! 

### How Do I Redeem a Coupon Code?

In order to redeem your coupon code, you will need to create a [Vonage API account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?icid=tryitfree_api-developer-adp_nexmodashbdfreetrialsignup_nav). Once you have created your account and confirmed your email address, take a look at your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/).

On the left-hand side of your dashboard, you will see what your balance is. Typically, if you created a new account, you will see a balance of €2.
(**Note**: Your balance will be shown in Euro (€) regardless of your location).

Next, click on your name on the left-hand side to expand the menu, then click on "Coupons". 

**Note:** If this is your first time redeeming a coupon, you will see a prompt to enter a service address first. See below image. This is done for tax purposes and can not be skipped. If you don't have a business address, please enter your home address.

Once you have entered your service address, or if this is not your first time redeeming a coupon, you will see the coupon redemption window.

The coupon redemption will open. In this view, navigate to the text box, enter your coupon code, and click the "Submit" button.

If your coupon was successfully redeemed, you will see two things:

1. A small pop up with a green border will announce: "Coupon successfully applied".
2. Your balance will have increased by the coupon amount. 

*Congratulations, you have successfully redeemed your coupon code!*

### What if Something Went Wrong?

![Coupon failed screenshot with arrow pointing at the error message.](/content/blog/how-to-redeem-a-coupon-code/couponfailedcouponnot-found.png "Coupon failed screenshot with arrow pointing at the error message.")

If your coupon redemption has failed, you will see a red border around the coupon code box with an error message stating why the coupon redemption has failed. In this case, double-check that you have entered the coupon code correctly and try again. 

If the redemption keeps failing, please message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VonageDev) or send us a message in the [Community Slack Channel](https://developer.vonage.com/community/slack). Be sure to include the coupon code you are attempting to redeem and the error message you are seeing, so we can investigate (and resolve) the problem.
