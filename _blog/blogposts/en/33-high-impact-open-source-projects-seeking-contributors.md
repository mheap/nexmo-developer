There is no shortage of open source projects dedicated to social change and improving lives. However, projects with a social good application often do not get the support and attention they deserve. This is unfortunate as the collaborative nature of open source can spark innovation and accelerate social good.

Therefore, in the spirit of Hacktoberfest, we have put together thirty-three projects that show the potential for open source to make a real social impact. The projects have various open issues, many of which are labelled `hacktoberfest` and will count towards the four pull requests required of the challenge. Whether you're new to development, a student, or a long-time contributor, you can make positive contributions and help drive open source growth in an ever-growing global community.

The projects below are organized according to technology. We encourage you to contribute to projects within your skillset **and** explore projects that inspire growth—all while changing the world, one pull request at a time.
