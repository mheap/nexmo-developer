The past few years have seen the rise of application development platforms that require minimal coding and allow developers to build everything from simple workflows all the way to comprehensive applications that replace legacy systems.

As a matter of fact, the research firm Gartner expects that so-called "low-code" platforms will account for a whopping 65% of application development by 2024. That is a key piece of the digital transformation happening in companies around the world.
 
It impacts everything from Customer Experience to backend processes across all sectors: financial services, insurance, healthcare and telemedicine, field services, public sector, education, commerce, logistics, and more.

[OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com) is a recognized leader in modern application development. In the OutSystems visual development environment, you can easily build an app with communication workflows thanks to the drag-and-drop Vonage components built by LINKIT, which are available now on the [OutSystems Forge marketplace](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/list?q=&t=&o=most-popular&tr=False&oss=False&c=&a=&v=&hd=False&tn=vonage&scat=forge). 

Here is a short video showing how easily you can build a Vonage-powered workflow on OutSystems in very little time.
