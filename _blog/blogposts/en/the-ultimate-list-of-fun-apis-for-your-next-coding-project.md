As programmers, when we finish with our job, we like to, well, program. From Hackathons to side projects, we love building things outside of work. Sometimes, though, it can be hard to come up with ideas for what to make next. When that happens, it is often helpful to learn about new APIs to get inspired. That is why I put together the ultimate list of fun APIs you may not have heard of. Hopefully, checking out these APIs will give you your next idea for a fun side project. Or who knows, it might end up becoming the next Instagram!

## What is an API?

If you aren’t familiar with APIs, API stands for application programming interface and is a way for two or more pieces of software to communicate. For example, Google has an API that allows you to get information about maps and Twitter has an API that lets you send tweets programmatically. Usually, an API usually has documentation that lets you know how to request information from it. 

There are thousands of APIs for all sorts of different purposes. In this list, you will find APIs that do everything from guessing a person’s age based on their name to letting you trade stocks. So, without further ado, here are some awesome APIs you can use for your next coding project!

## Interesting Data

### 1. NASA Open APIs

NASA provides a bunch of super exciting APIs for the public. They have an API called Astronomy Picture of the Day that returns a new picture from space each day, an API to get the weather on Mars, and an API just for Mars Rover photos. 

[Learn more](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html).

### 2.  SpaceX API

Speaking of space, did you know Elon Musk’s SpaceX has an API? You can use the SpaceX API to get launch, rocket, core, capsule, Starlink, launchpad, and landing pad data.

## Fun APIs

### 8. Agify API

The Agify API is a fun API that tries to predict your age from your name. You don’t need an API key to get started, so you can just send a request with your name in it to find out how old their algorithm thinks you are. 

<https://api.agify.io/?name=cory>

[Learn more. ](https://api.agify.io.)

### 9. Pokemon API

With the Pokemon API, you can send a rest request with a Pokemon name, and it will send you a JSON response with their information. For example, here is how to send a request for Charizard: 

https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charizard

Like the Agify API, you don’t need to register for an API key. You can type that request into your browser as is and get a response. 

[Learn more. ](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)

### 10. Kanye Rest API

Kanye Rest is a free REST API for random Kanye West quotes (also known as Kanye as a service). Every time you visit the endpoint https://api.kanye.rest/, the API returns a new Kanye quote, like "You can't look at a glass half full or empty if it's overflowing." The API is free to use. The documentation suggests using it to spice up your Git commit messages, but the sky's the limit to what you can do with this data.

### 12. Fun Translations API

The Fun Translations API allows you to use several language APIs under one plan. Some of the many language APIs you get access to include the Yoda API, which translates English to Yodish, a Pig Latin API, and an API to translate Dothraki (from Game of Thrones). 

[Learn more. ](https://funtranslations.com/api/)

### 13. Balldontlie API

The Balldontlie API allows you to access NBA-related data. For example, you can get a list of all of the NBA teams, information about specific games, player stats, and more. I’m a big basketball fan, so I may have to start a side project with this API myself.  

[Learn more. ](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction)

### 14. Genius API

Genius is a website that allows anyone to add annotations to song lyrics and other written text. For example, you can add comments to a song explaining why a verse is significant. With the Genius API, you can get data about songs, including song lyrics and annotations.

### 24. GitHub Jobs API

You can use the GitHub Jobs API to get information about all of the jobs on GitHub’s jobs board.  

[Learn more. ](https://jobs.github.com/api)

### 25. Vonage APIs

With this API, I’m saving the best for last! I recently became a developer advocate for Vonage, and I am having a ton of fun playing with our APIs. Vonage has an SMS API that lets you send text messages in just a few lines of code, a voice API that allows you to make calls, and a bunch of other awesome APIs. I recently used Vonage’s APIs to create a side-project called Songagram where you can pick a song and give a friend’s phone number, and the program will scrape the lyrics, call your friend, and read them the lyrics.

### Final Thoughts

Hopefully, this list gave you some inspiration for your next coding project. After researching APIs for this list, I am especially excited about The Cloud Natural Language API, the Coinbase Digital Currency API, the Associated Press API, the EventBrite API, and of course, the Vonage APIs. I’m interested in building something that combines several of them. Perhaps a program that uses the Cloud Natural Language API to analyze the news and trade cryptocurrency based on its sentiment. Or maybe I will use the Eventbrite API to write code to find tech events I might want to speak at and alert me with a text using Vonage’s SMS API when it's time to submit my proposed speech.

Whether you are excited about the same APIs as I am or are more interested in other APIs on the list, with all of these excellent APIs to choose from,  it is such an exciting time to be a programmer!
