October has just finished, and for the team here at Vonage, it was a busy one. Earlier in the year, we committed to join this year's [Hacktoberfest](https://nexmo.dev/2GZcyHc), which meant that our October would only be about one thing—Open Source.

We’re no strangers to Open Source at Vonage, with our libraries, code snippets, and demos all on [GitHub](https://github.com/vonage), and many of our team contributing to, or maintaining other work in addition to that.

We thoroughly enjoyed supporting participants throughout October, sharing our knowledge, and chatting about how significant and awesome open source contributions can be.

## What Was Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://nexmo.dev/2GZcyHc) has become a key event in the Open Source community’s calendar over the years. Participants were encouraged and rewarded for suggesting changes to software repositories, making the repositories more accurate and accessible for everyone to use.

Every person who submitted four successful requests during Hacktoberfest will now be rewarded with swag, including a Hacktoberfest t-shirt and Vonage-branded stickers, or have the opportunity to plant a tree.

Additionally, we also offered $5 Open Collective gift cards and what turned out to be our most in-demand bit of swag ever:

*Bamboo Vonage Socks*.

## Our Hacktoberfest In Numbers

We'll break down this information a bit more below, but if you're looking for the TL;DR, here's what Hacktoberfest 2020 looked like for us:

## Contributions

The most crucial part of any Hacktoberfest is the contributions that people make to projects. October saw a 254% increase in PRs (pull requests) opened across our repositories compared to the average of the last 12 months.

The number of total PRs tagged Hacktoberfest was 226, out of which 157 were tagged `hacktoberfest-accepted` and 117 contributions were merged.

## Events

Community and education are also at the heart of Hacktoberfest. With many of the participants making their first contributions to Open Source, providing a place to learn, communicate, inspire, and collaborate was vital.

### Hacktoberfest Tuesdays

Our Hacktoberfest Tuesday's events took place every Tuesday (obviously) in October, covering Asia, Europe, Israel, and the Americas.

Taking the form of a small virtual conference, attendees could watch inspiring talks from both our team and special guest maintainers as well as have the opportunity to get their questions answered and spend time with our team.

### Official and Community Events

In addition to our events, there were several official Hacktoberfest events, and many more community organized events to be a part of. We were all over those as well!

[Lorna Mitchell](https://twitter.com/lornajane), one of our Senior Developer Advocates, spoke at the first official Hacktoberfest event earlier in the month:

Additionally, our colleagues took to the 'virtual' stage in a truly international manner:

* [Garann](https://twitter.com/garannm) spoke at virtual events in [Paraguay](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/4702-hacktoberfest-online-asuncion-2020), [India](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/5055-iiit-sonepat-hacktoberfest-meetup), and the [U.K.](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/4411-virtual-hacktoberfest-2020-r-u-hacking)
* [Ben](https://twitter.com/rabbigreenberg) represented in [India](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/4525-acm-juit-open-source-season-hacktoberfest-meetup) and [Israel](https://www.facebook.com/events/1861470224026415).
* [Diana](https://twitter.com/cotufa82) touched areas that we had previously never reached with talks in [Pakistan](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/4762-hacktoberfest-karachi) and [Nepal](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/4275-hacktoberfest-meetup-nepal) as well as [India](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/4525-acm-juit-open-source-season-hacktoberfest-meetup).

## Education

We created 47 new education resources spanning tutorials, articles, videos, and talks to support the community during this year's event.

Each week there was something to dive into that would either get you started, inspire your next contribution or give you food for thought.

In October, one of the highlight articles was [Nahrin's](https://twitter.com/nahrinjalal) [33 High Impact Open Source Projects Seeking Contributors](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2020/10/16/33-high-impact-open-source-projects-seeking-contributors) that outlined projects that were making people's lives better, impacting societal change or environmental issues (amongst many other things).

It's a fantastic resource if you're looking to give back through your Open Source contributions. Regardless of your programming language of choice, you will find something interesting to get involved with.

## Live Streaming

According to our stats, we streamed over 43 hours of Hacktoberfest specific content on Twitch in October. That is huge!

On top of our regular live streams, we committed to streaming every single working weekday in October to support Hacktoberfest on our [VonageDevs Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/vonagedevs) channel.

It was great to have so many regular viewers join us throughout the month. We celebrated with a special, chaotic, all-team stream on Friday, 30th October, where we took the time to highlight key moments, superb contributions, fantastic community members, and more.

## Contributions Always Welcome

If you contributed a PR, attended an event, hung out in the Discord, chatted with us on a live stream, or enjoyed one of our talks, *thank you*.

It was a lot of work, but we truly enjoyed being a part of this year's Hacktoberfest and especially being part of the community alongside you.

It doesn't end here, though. Open Source is not just for October! You are more than welcome to contribute to our projects at any time, regardless of your background or experience.
