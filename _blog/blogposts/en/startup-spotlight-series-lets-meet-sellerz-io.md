It’s no secret that time management is one of the key requirements for succeeding in sales. Companies want their salespeople to focus on revenue-generating activities and minimise wasting their time on admin tasks such as working through emails, gathering sales intelligence, and scheduling meetings.

However, research suggests that today’s salespeople spend most of their time on activities other than sales. The [research](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/salespeople-spend-less-than-half-day-selling-data) into what sales reps do with their daily schedule has found that only 39% of the time is spent actively selling. This is just 13 hours a week for a typical 9-5 employee. The rest of the time is spent on activities that don’t directly generate revenue for the business.

Sellerz.io is here to tackle this significant productivity challenge and ensure that revenue teams focus on tasks that matter. Read our interview with their CEO & Co-Founder, Yuval Ben-Itzhak, to learn more about how Sellerz.io is improving sales organisations' efficiency and results. Enjoy!

# The startup at a glance

**Startup Name**: [Sellerz.io](http://sellerz.io/) 

**Industry**: SaaS

**Location**: Israel and Czech Republic

**Date founded**: May 2021

**Number of employees**: 5

**Vonage API used**: Video API

# In two sentences, what does Sellerz.io do?

Sellerz.io provides a real-time sales automation platform that helps B2B revenue teams increase their productivity by 40%. By leveraging AI, we enrich live video calls with data and automate non-selling tasks, such as scheduling meetings, lead research, prospecting, industry news searching, data entry, and even sales training.

# What is the problem you are solving? Was this the initial issue, or did you pivot?

On average, salespeople spend 40% of their time on non-selling tasks (scheduling meetings, contact research, prospecting, data entry, sales training, etc.). As a result, they are less productive, and their response to prospects is slow. Sellerz.io automates these tasks and enables prospects to engage with sellers in real-time. That helps the revenue team to become more productive and win more business, faster.



We started during COVID time and focused on challenges E-commerce salespeople were having. Very quickly, we realized that we could serve a broad range of verticals that have similar challenges. We had to adjust our messaging and product to fit the horizontal B2B market.

 

# What differentiates Sellerz.io from your competitors? Is there a secret sauce?

While our competitors focus on helping sales representatives book meetings with prospects by sharing their availability over public calendars, we introduced an innovative solution that eliminates these steps and let prospects initiate a live video call with sellers straight from email or website. As a result, sellers win more business as prospects’ purchase intent is much higher.

Overall, we are making sellers 40% more productive by automating their non-selling tasks – scheduling meetings, contact research, prospecting, training, etc.

Our secret source is our AI. Our AI engine routes incoming sales calls to the best available seller. It enriches the video call with information about the calling prospects or company and guides the seller throughout the video call with a sales blueprint. By leveraging our algorithms, the AI engine validates and ranks how each seller performed vs the sales blueprint.

# VC, Angel, Bootstrap, or Other?

We are a bootstrap business that was founded by two serial entrepreneurs.

 

# What’s the biggest challenge you faced, and how did you overcome it?

Our initial value proposition message and marketing efforts targeted the C-level decision-makers in the sales and marketing groups. However, as a bootstrap business, we do not have the resources and funding to reach and engage with these people, as well-funded SaaS companies are targeting themes already. Once we identified our go to market challenge, we shifted our messaging and product value to the sales representative, user-persona. Having a product-led-growth (PLG) strategy, the user-persona can validate the value of our product and introduce Selelrz.io into the organization. Overall, we believe PLG is the better option for bootstrap businesses.

# What's the biggest mistake Sellerz.io has made so far and what did you learn from it?

A success is a sum of mistakes. We had a mistake in selecting our initial video technology partner, before evaluating and selecting Vonage. We had a mistake in the initial value proposition of our product. We had a mistake in marketing our product. What we learned from all these mistakes is that while more will happen in the future, we better identify them fast and move forward.



# You can choose one to be on your board: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Who do you choose and why? 

Jeff Bezos would be our vote. While Mr. Gates can be a great mentor and Mr. Musk be the headlines maker for our business, Mr. Bezos, who founded Amazon and the AWS would be the best fit as a Board member. Looking at Mr. Bezos’ career path, achievements and business culture, we find him as the best candidate for our Board.

Can you make it happen, please? :-)



# How have you been using Vonage’s APIs?

After evaluating various video and audio APIs from both open-source and SaaS vendors, we selected the Vonage video and phone APIs to power our platform. Thanks to the flexibility and rich feature set, implementing our core use-cases was a breeze and flawless. The support and partnership teams are very accessible and supportive, far and beyond what we have experienced with other vendors.

# What progress have you made since launching? 

Since our launch we started to get good traction from revenue teams who learned about our solution and experimented with the platform.

# What’s next for Sellerz.io? Where do you want to be in 3 years?

Our vision is to become the first on-demand seller-as-a-service platform for businesses. As AWS did for data centers, WeWork did for real estate, or Wolt did for delivery, Sales can also be delivered as an on-demand service.
