# Create your Vonage Application

In this step you will create a Vonage [Application](/conversation/concepts/application) capable of in-app Chat communication use cases.

> **NOTE:** This is the Vonage application project that allows client application to use Vonage backend.

**1.** Create your project directory if you've not already done so.

``` shell
mkdir vonage-tutorial
```

**2.** Change into the project directory.

``` shell
cd vonage-tutorial
```

**3.** Create a Vonage application by copying and pasting the command below into terminal.

``` shell
nexmo app:create "App to App Chat Tutorial" --capabilities=rtc --keyfile=private.key  --rtc-event-url=https://example.com/
```

A file named `.nexmo-app` is created in your project directory and contains the newly created Vonage Application ID and the private key. A private key file named `private.key` is also created.

**Please make a note of the Application ID as you'll need it in the future.**

> **NOTE:** An application can be also created using the CLI's [interactive mode](/application/nexmo-cli#interactive-mode).

> **NOTE:** For more details on how to create an application and various available application capabilities please see our [documentation](/application/overview).

> **NOTE:** You can also obtain information about your application, including the Application ID, in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/your-applications).
