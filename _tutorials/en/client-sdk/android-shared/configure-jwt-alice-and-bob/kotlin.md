# Configure JWTs

Now it's time to fill previously generated `JWT` tokens.

Open `Config.kt` file and replace `ALICE_TOKEN` and `BOB_TOKEN` placeholders with real values:

```kotlin
object Config {

    val alice = User(
        "Alice",
        "ALICE_TOKEN" // TODO: "set Alice's JWT token"
    )
    val bob = User(
        "Bob",
        "BOB_TOKEN" // TODO: "set Bob's JWT token"
    )
}
```

Notice that these values are hardcoded. This makes it easier to use these values later in this tutorial, however in production application they should be retrieved from external API.
