Generate JWT
============

The JWT is used to authenticate the user. Execute the following command in the terminal to generate a JWT for the user `Alice`.

In the following command replace the `APPLICATION_ID` with id of your application:

```shell
nexmo jwt:generate sub=Alice exp=$(($(date +%s)+86400)) acl='{"paths":{"/*/users/**":{},"/*/conversations/**":{},"/*/sessions/**":{},"/*/devices/**":{},"/*/image/**":{},"/*/media/**":{},"/*/applications/**":{},"/*/push/**":{},"/*/knocking/**":{}}}' application_id=APPLICATION_ID
```

The above command set the expiry of the JWT to one day from now, which is the maximum.

Make a note of the JWT you generated for the user.

> **NOTE** : In a production environment, your application should expose an endpoint that generates a JWT for each client request.
