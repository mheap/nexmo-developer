# Generate a JWT

The JWT is used to authenticate the user. Execute the following command in the terminal to generate a JWT for the user `Alice`.

In the following command replace the `APPLICATION_ID` with the ID of your application:

``` shell
nexmo jwt:generate sub=Alice exp=$(($(date +%s)+86400)) acl='{"paths":{"/*/users/**":{},"/*/conversations/**":{},"/*/sessions/**":{},"/*/devices/**":{},"/*/image/**":{},"/*/media/**":{},"/*/applications/**":{},"/*/push/**":{},"/*/knocking/**":{},"/*/legs/**":{}}}'
```

The command above sets the expiry of the JWT to one day from now, which is the maximum.

Make a note of the JWT you generated for Alice.

> **NOTE**: In a production environment, your application should expose an endpoint that generates a JWT for each client request.
