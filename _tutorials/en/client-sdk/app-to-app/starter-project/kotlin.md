# The Starter Project

To make things easier, a `Starter` project is provided for you. It is a simple Android Studio project that contains an application with the following two screens:

1. Clone this [GitHub project](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-android-tutorial-voice-app-to-app).

3. Open the project in the `Android Studio` - navigate to the menu `File -> Open` and select the `kotlin-start` folder from cloned repository.

The application consists of four screens: 

- **login** - responsible for logging the user
- **main** - allows to start a call and listens for incoming call
- **incoming call** - answer or reject incoming call
- **on call** - displayed during ongoing call, allows to end current call
