# Create your Vonage application

You now need to create a Vonage [Application](/conversation/concepts/application). In this step you create an application capable of handling both in-app Voice and in-app Messaging use cases.

**1.** Create your project directory if you've not already done so.

``` shell
mkdir vonage-tutorial
```

**2.** Change into the project directory.

``` shell
cd vonage-tutorial
```

**3.** Create a Vonage application [interactively](/application/nexmo-cli#interactive-mode). The following command enters interactive mode:

``` shell
nexmo app:create
```


**4.** Specify your application name. Press Enter to continue.

**5.** You can now select your application capabilities using the arrow keys and then pressing spacebar to select the 
capabilities your application needs. For the purposes of this example select both Voice and RTC capabilities using the arrow keys and spacebar to select. Once you have selected both Voice and RTC capabilities press Enter to continue.

> **NOTE:** If your application will be in-app voice only you can select Voice capabilities only. If you want in-app messaging select only RTC capabilities. If your app will have both in-app voice and in-app messaging select both capabilities.

**6.** For "Use the default HTTP methods?" press Enter to select the default.

**7.** For "Voice Answer URL" enter `https://example.ngrok.io/webhooks/answer` or other suitable URL (this depends on how you are testing).

**8.** You are next prompted for the "Voice Fallback Answer URL". This is an optional fallback URL should your main 
Voice 
Answer URL fail for some reason. In this case press Enter. If later you need the fallback URL you can add it in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-in), or using the Nexmo CLI.

**9.** You are now required to enter the "Voice Event URL". Enter `https://example.ngrok.io/webhooks/event`.

**10.** For " RTC Event URL" enter `https://example.ngrok.io/webhooks/rtc`.

**11.** For "Public Key path" press Enter to select the default. If you want to use your own public-private key pair 
refer
to [this documentation](/application/nexmo-cli#creating-an-application-with-your-own-public-private-key-pair).

**12.** For "Private Key path" type in `private.key` and press Enter.

A file named `.nexmo-app` is created in your project directory and contains the newly created Vonage Application ID and the private key. A private key file named `private.key` is also created.

**Please make a note of it as you'll need it in the future.**
