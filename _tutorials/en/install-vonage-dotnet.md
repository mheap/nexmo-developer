# Install Vonage Package

To install the Vonage NuGet package, change directory into the `VonageVoice` repository and run the following command:

```shell
dotnet add package Vonage
```

You can now open the `VonageVoice.csproj` file in Visual Studio.

> **Note**: This tutorial assumes that you are using Visual Studio. Alternatively, you could open the `VonageVoice` folder in Visual Studio Code or another editor, but you might have to create some of the scaffolding that Visual Studio generates for you.
