# Signed Webhooks [Developer Preview]

Signed webhooks provide a method for your application to verify a request is coming from Vonage, and its payload has not been tampered with during transit. 

> Voice API Signed webhooks are currently offered as [Developer Preview](/product-lifecycle/dev-preview). The feature can be used in your projects for supported scenarios (see below). The following limitations apply:
<ul style='list-style:disc;margin-left:16px;margin-top:16px;'><li style='margin-bottom:16px;'>a limited set of events supported,</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:16px;'>activation can be done through Applications API request only.</li></ul>

## Activation

Follow these steps to activate signed callbacks for your application.

### Get Application

Retrieve your application data with a [Get an application](/api/application.v2#getApplication) HTTP request using [Postman](/tools/postman) or another HTTP client of your choice:

```http
GET https://api.nexmo.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
```

Copy the response body:

```json
{
    "id": "YOUR_APPLICATION_ID",
    "name": "My app",
    "keys": {
        "public_key": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
    },
    "capabilities": {
        "voice": {
            "webhooks": {
                "event_url": {
                    "address": "https://example.com",
                    "http_method": "POST"
                },
                "fallback_answer_url": {
                    "address": "",
                    "http_method": "GET"
                },
                "answer_url": {
                    "address": "https://example.com",
                    "http_method": "GET"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/v2/applications/YOUR_APPLICATION_ID"
        }
    }
}
```

> Unlike Voice API, the Applications API uses [header-based API Key and Secret Authentication] (https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/authentication#header-based-api-key-and-secret-authentication), which means you should use a [Base64](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4) encoded API key and secret joined by a colon in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request.

### Update Application

Update your application with a [Update an application](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/application.v2#updateApplication) HTTP request:

```http
PUT https://api.nexmo.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
```

Use the response JSON from the previous step as the request body with the addition of the `signed_callbacks` parameter:

```json
{
    "id": "YOUR_APPLICATION_ID",
    "name": "My app",
    "keys": {
        "public_key": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
    },
    "capabilities": {
        "voice": {
            "webhooks": {
                "event_url": {
                    "address": "https://example.com",
                    "http_method": "POST"
                },
                "fallback_answer_url": {
                    "address": "",
                    "http_method": "GET"
                },
                "answer_url": {
                    "address": "https://example.com",
                    "http_method": "GET"
                }
            },
            "signed_callbacks": true
        }
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/v2/applications/YOUR_APPLICATION_ID"
        }
    }
}
```

You can make a `GET` request from step one again to ensure the parameter is applied (it should be returned in the response).

> Developer Preview limitation: if you change any parameter of your application via [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com), the `signed_callbacks` parameter will be dropped, and the feature will be inactivated, so you have to go through the activation steps again to turn it back on.

## Validating Signed Webhooks

See [Signed webhooks](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/concepts/signed-webhooks#validating-signed-webhooks) in the Messages API Concepts section. Voice signed callbacks have the same [JWT](https://jwt.io/) in the `Authorization` header, which your application is supposed to validate.

## Supported Events and Scenarios

At the moment, only the following events are supported:

* [`started`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#started#started)
* [`ringing`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#ringing)
* [`answered`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#answered)
* [`completed`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#completed)
* [`busy`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#busy)
* [`cancelled`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#cancelled)
* [`unanswered`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#unanswered)
* [`rejected`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#rejected)
* [`failed`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#failed)
* [`record`](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#record)

All the other events, as well as the initial [answer](/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#answer-webhook) webhook, are still sent without the signature (`Authorization` header).

With this limitation, you can use the signed webhooks now for a basic voice alert or two-factor authentication scenario, using a [Create an outbound call](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/voice#createCall) API request with an embedded `NCCO`:

```json
{
  "to": [
    {
      "type": "phone",
      "number": "'$TO_NUMBER'"
    }
  ],
  "from": {
    "type": "phone",
    "number": "'$YOUR_NEXMO_NUMBER'"
  },
  "ncco": [
    {
      "action": "talk",
      "text": "Your code is '$TEMP_CODE'"
    }
  ]
}
```
