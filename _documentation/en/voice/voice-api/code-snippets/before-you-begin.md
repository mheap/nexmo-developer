# Before you begin

## What are Code Snippets?

Code snippets are short pieces of code you can reuse in your own applications.
The code snippets use code from [example repositories](https://github.com/topics/nexmo-quickstart).

Please read this information carefully, so you can best use the code snippets.  

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a Vonage account](/account/guides/dashboard-management#create-and-configure-a-nexmo-account)
2. [Rent a Vonage Number](/numbers/guides/number-management#rent-a-virtual-number)
3. [Install the Vonage Command Line tools](/tools)
4. [Create a Vonage Application using the command line tools or Dashboard](/concepts/guides/applications#getting-started-with-applications)
5. [Install the Vonage Library for your programming language](/tools)
6. [Set up Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

## Replaceable variables

### Generic replaceable

The following replaceable information depends on the library and specific call:

```snippet_variables
- VONAGE_API_KEY
- VONAGE_API_SECRET
- VONAGE_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
- VONAGE_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY
- VONAGE_APPLICATION_ID
```

### Numbers

All phone numbers are in E.164 format.

```snippet_variables
- VONAGE_NUMBER
- TO_NUMBER.VOICE
- SECOND_NUMBER.VOICE
```

### UUIDs

UUIDs are typically used in the code snippets to identify a specific call.

```snippet_variables
- UUID.VOICE
```

### Specific replaceable/variables

Some code snippets have more specialized variables that will need to be
replaced by actual values. These may be specified on a per-code snippet basis.

## Authentication

Voice API requires authentication using JWTs. You can generate a JWT using the [Vonage CLI](/concepts/authentication) or the [online tool](/jwt).

## Webhooks

The main ones you will meet here are:

* `/webhooks/answer` - Vonage makes a GET request here when you receive an inbound call. You respond with an NCCO.
* `/webhooks/event` - Vonage makes POST requests here when an event occurs. You receive a JSON event.
* `/webhooks/recordings` - Vonage makes a POST request here when the recording is available. You receive a JSON object with recording details.
* `/webhooks/dtmf` - Vonage POSTs user DTMF input here in a JSON object.

If you are using Ngrok you will set your webhook URLs in the Vonage Application object to
something like:

* `https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/answer`
* `https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/event`
* `https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/recordings`
* `https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/dtmf`

Change `demo` in the above with whatever applies in your case.
