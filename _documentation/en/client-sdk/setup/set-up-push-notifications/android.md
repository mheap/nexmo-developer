# Overview

On incoming events such as a new message, or an incoming call, the user often expects to receive a push notification or the app itself. If the app is not active (is in the background), push notifications are the only way to notify app about new events.

This guide explains how to configure your Android app to receive push notifications from the Client SDK.

## Set up Firebase project for your Android application

In order to enable push notifications for your Android application, you need to configure your Android application, create a new Firebase project and connect it to your Vonage API application.

## Configure Android project 

Let's start with setting up Android project.

### To add the Client SDK dependency

[Add Client SDK](/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app) to your project.

### Add Firebase Cloud Messaging dependency

In your IDE, in your app level `build.gradle` file (usually `app/build.gradle`), add the `firebase-messaging` dependency:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/setup/push-notifications/android/dependencies'
```

> **NOTE:** The latest version number can be found on the [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#add_firebase_sdks_to_your_app).

### Implement a custom service class to receive push notifications

If you do not have one already, create a class (service) that extends `FirebaseMessagingService`. 

In order for Vonage API application to be able to send push notifications to a device, the Vonage server has to know the device `token`, also known as `InstanceID`.

In your class that extends `FirebaseMessagingService`,  override `onNewToken()` method and update the `NexmoClient` by passing new `token`:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/setup/push-notifications/android/firebase-new-token'
```

Make sure your service is declared in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (typically `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`) by adding `service` tag inside `application` tag:

```xml
<service android:name=".MyFirebaseMessagingService">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
    </intent-filter>
</service>
```

### Receive push notifications

Push notifications are received in your implementation of `MyFirebaseMessagingService`, on `onMessageReceived()` method.

You can use `NexmoClient.isNexmoPushNotification(message.data))` to determine if the message is sent from Vonage server.

Use `processPushNotification(message.data, listener)` to process the data received from Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) into a ready to use object:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/setup/push-notifications/android/firebase-receive-push-notifications'
```

> **NOTE:** In order to apply any methods on the `NexmoClient` object (for example answer a call, hangup, and so on), the `NexmoClient` has to be initialized and the user has to be [logged in](/client-sdk/getting-started/add-sdk-to-your-app/android) to it.

## Connect Vonage API application to Firebase

To connect Vonage API Application with Firebase you will need the following:

1. Vonage API Application id
2. Vonage developer JWT 
3. Firebase project id
4. Firebase token

### Get Vonage application Id

Obtain your `VONAGE_APP_ID`. You can access existing application in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/your-applications). If you don't have an application already you can create the new application via [Nexmo CLI](/client-sdk/setup/create-your-application).

### Generate a Vonage developer JWT

[JWTs](https://jwt.io) are used to authenticate a user into the Client SDK.

To generate a `VONAGE_DEV_JWT` run the following command. Remember to replace the `VONAGE_APP_ID` with id of your Vonage application:

```bash
nexmo jwt:generate ./private.key exp=$(($(date +%s)+86400)) acl='{"paths":{"/*/users/**":{},"/*/conversations/**":{},"/*/sessions/**":{},"/*/devices/**":{},"/*/image/**":{},"/*/media/**":{},"/*/applications/**":{},"/*/push/**":{},"/*/knocking/**":{},"/*/legs/**":{}}}' application_id=VONAGE_APP_ID
```

> **NOTE** The above commands set the expiry of the JWT to one day from now, which is the maximum.

> **NOTE** A `VONAGE_DEV_JWT` is a JWT without a sub claim. 

> **NOTE:** More details on how to generate a JWT can be found in the [setup guide](/tutorials/client-sdk-generate-test-credentials#generate-a-user-jwt).

### Get Firebase project Id

Get your `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Navigate to `Firebase console -> Project settings -> General`.

### Get Firebase token

Get your `FIREBASE_TOKEN` from the Firebase console. Navigate to `Firebase console ->  Project settings -> Service accounts` and generate a new private key.

## Link the Vonage backend push service with the Firebase application

To link the Vonage backend push service with the Firebase application you need to make a single request.

Fill `VONAGE_APP_ID`, `VONAGE_DEV_JWT`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and `FIREBASE_TOKEN` with previously obtained values and run the below command:

```sh
VONAGE_APP_ID=
VONAGE_DEV_JWT=
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_TOKEN=

curl -v -X PUT \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $VONAGE_DEV_JWT" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d "{\"token\":\"$FIREBASE_TOKEN\", \"projectId\":\"$FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID\"}" \
   https://api.nexmo.com/v1/applications/$VONAGE_APP_ID/push_tokens/android  
```

## Putting it all together

Now you can test your push notification setup by calling any user. Incoming call will trigger `onIncomingCall` callback presented above.

## Conclusion

In this guide you have seen how to set up push notifications.
