# Cancel a Number

If you no longer require a Vonage virtual number that you have [purchased]() you can cancel it.

This page shows you how to cancel a number programmatically.

> You can also cancel a number online, using the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/your-numbers) or from the command line, using the [Vonage CLI](https://github.com/vonage/vonage-cli#cancelling-a-number).

Replace the following variables in the sample code with your own values:

```snippet_variables
- VONAGE_API_KEY
- VONAGE_API_SECRET
- COUNTRY_CODE
- VONAGE_NUMBER
```

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/numbers/cancel'
```
