    # Introduction

    In this tutorial, you will learn how to build an interactive voice response (IVR) call menu. An IVR is a great way to automate the handling of simple customer enquiries and reduce the workload of your customer support team.

    When a user calls your Vonage number, they will be presented with two options. One will read the current date and time to the caller using text-to-speech and the other will play an audio file.
